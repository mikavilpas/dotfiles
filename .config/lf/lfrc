# Split words by default in zsh
#
# zsh does not split words by default as described here, which makes it
# difficult to work with $fs and $fx variables, but a compatibility option
# named shwordsplit (-y or --sh-word-split) is provided for this purpose. You
# can set this option for all commands as such:
set shell zsh
set shellopts '-euy'
set ifs "\n"
set previewer "~/dotfiles/.config/lf/previewer.sh"

# Can be executed when embedded in a nvim process. Opens the selected file or directory in the current window.
map <enter> ${{
  [ -f $f ] && nvr --nostart -remote "$f"

  # TODO directory opening doesn't work yet
  #[ -d $f ] && nvr --nostart --remote-expr ":Neotree<cr>"

  killall lf

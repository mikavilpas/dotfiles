# My yazi setup

## ðŸ˜Ž Plugins

For an overview of plugins, see
<https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/overview>.

Some plugins that I like:

- <https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump.yazi> allows jumping to a line by
  typing a hint character, much like
  [hop.nvim](https://github.com/smoka7/hop.nvim)
- <https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/starship.yazi> is a port of the
  [starship prompt](https://starship.rs) to yazi. It allows reusing the prompt
  you are using in your shell in yazi.

## Keybindings

These keybindings are used when running yazi inside neovim.

| Key    | Action    |
| ------ | --------- |
| `<up>` | Open yazi |

These keybindings can be used in yazi itself.

| Key | Action       |
| --- | ------------ |
| `i` | jump to line |
